create a buffer pool for live streams, because now they are just
multiplexed as they arrive, and broadcasting delay grows continously<br />- vp6/h264 rtmp implementation<br />- rtmpe decypher. it seems like a standard RC4 strream cypher, but i'm sure they changed something<br />- rtmpt maybe<br /><br />thats all folks!<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />05 06 2008</span><br /><br />Hey!
The long-lasting development of 0.8 beta is finally over!!! yaaaaay!
you can't imagine how happy i am with this, because i really got
depressed of the non-progress, and lack of time,&nbsp;one month
without any result triggers death-wish in me.<br /><br />But finally
its over. I've upgraded the reference, the unit tester is working, but i won't do any performance tuning until h264 and vp6
streaming isn't implemented, especially with adobe live fms. Live
streaming is really becoming one of the most important thing on the
net, and FP9 and 10 built in sorenson encoder is useless. the only
solution avaliable is adobe live encoder, so i will tune milenia for the use of
that.<br /><br />application scopes are already implemented in this version.<br /><br />
I'll bugfix the recorder part of the unit tester and the stress tester,
and i will put up the 0.8 beta application package in the downloads.
<p style="font-weight: bold;">08 04 2008</p>
<p>Good news everyone!!!</p>
<p>Finally,
i’m more-or-less ready with the new release of Milenia. It’s quite raw
right now, but in the next few days i will stabilize it. But till then,
you can already browse or checkout the source from google code ( thanks
Anjo for the tip, google code really rocks )</p>
<p>http://code.google.com/p/milgra/source/checkout</p>
<p>I’ve also created a google group for developer discussion</p>
<p>http://groups.google.com/group/milenia-grafter</p>
<p>If you want to follow Milenia related infos, please join the
group, i won’t disturb you in this direct way again.</p>
<p>I don’t know if the forum will be needed, but i will keep it
for a while.</p>
<p>Short feature list:</p>
<p>Live Audio/Video streaming<br />
Live Audio/Video recording<br />
Recorded FLV playback<br />
FLV playback speed set - slow/fast, forward/reverse<br />
Stream access control based on stream events<br />
Simple and fast custom application deployment<br />
Lightweight data communication<br />
Client mode - you can connect Milenia to any kind of flash media server<br />
Server to server Data/Audio/Video communication - stream pushing ,
clustering<br />
Fast as light, solid as rock!<br />
Admin console<br />
Stress tester<br />
Unit tester<br />
Built-in bandwidth check</p>
<p>I will come up with a downloadable stable version around the
weekend, i will notify everyone on groups.</p>
<p>The license is still GPL V2, and i won’t change it. I want the
world to be free and open.</p>
<p>cheers,</p>

<p>Hi
everybody! Long time no see? I know :) Well, that happnens when you
have to earn money for living, and there is no time for hobby :( But
bewaaare, Milenia 0.8 is on its way, with lots of very tasty things :D</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">27 January 2008</p>
<p>7c
52 74 6d 70 53 61 6d 70 6c 65 41 63 63 65 73 73 01 01 01 01 , what
means “|RtmpSampleAccess( true , true )”, and Mileania now enables
bitmapdrata draws, and computespectrums on rtmp streams. yeah!!! By the
way, if you are planning FMS license purchase, forget Streaming Server
licenses, it disables custom application creation! You have to buy the
interactive edition for the old extreme prizes... It's so annoying...
FMS3 is again a fantastic product from adobe, which was created by the
marketing division, not by programmers. "Twice streaming capacity"...
Of course, on a twice bigger processor... Oh, and about the new swf
hash check security feature - why adobe thinks that i cannot simply
send the desired hash/size code with a custom rtmp protocol? :D But
RTMPE seems interesting, i couldn't see any secure handshake, it seems
that the player send a key right at the start in the rtmp handshake.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">21 January 2008</p>
<p>First,
i would like to apologize, i haven't really had time for Milenia in the
past month. I've become the chief software architect at make.tv, and i
was under a heavy load in the past four weeks. The good thing about
this that we will use Milenia, and i can test it under extreme load, so
hopefully it will become the world's fastest rock stable rtmp server.
I'll try to finalize the .7 beta this weekend, but i can't promise
anything. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">2 January 2008</p>
<p>Hi
everybody, it's been a long time... Milenia Grafter Server 0.7 is on
its way, i have to finalize a few things, rewrite demo applications,
and it's ready. It features bugfixed flv recording, and flv playing,
the stream handling is now fms-like, you can play non-existing streams
now, and wait for a publisher, you can also create persistent streams
for web-tv projects. API is changed, a Stream class were born, and it's
6Kbytes smaller than the previous version. Keep waiting!!!</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">25 October 2007</p>
<p>And the first public version is ready!!!! YEEEEEAAAAHHH!!!</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">10 October 2007</p>
<p>Serialized
sucking was the keyword for the last three days, i have to totally
rewrite rtmp serialization to take chunk splitting/merging to a higher
level to ensure network traffic's better scattering. and after this
another two things occused the same bug which caused rewriting. but
now, it is flawless. i'm finishing stress tester, then milenia grafter
chat demo. yupeeee.</p>
<p>interesting fact: it seems
like that flash player instances use a common stream
comressos/decompressor pool, because decompression error in one player
caeses stream death in every other players.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">03 October 2007</p>
<p>Let's see what have i done in the last 2 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A very fast masspoint dynamics engine lack of geometrical
shapes, in java/AS3</p>
<p>an RTMP serializer and deserializer<br />
</p>
<p>an AMF serializer and deserializer<br />
</p>
<p>a stream manager<br />
</p>
<p>a thread manager optimized for a flash media server<br />
</p>
<p>a media server framework</p>
<p>spectacular AS3 effects, exploding, cube-turn, displaced
transitions<br />
</p>
<p>table, slider, textfield components<br />
</p>
<p>a simple mulit-user video chat<br />
</p>
<p>a full-featured admin for milenia grafter sever full of effects</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm in deep love with myself :D</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">02 October 2007</p>
<p>Flash's
gradientFill is a totally useless crap. It showed three different
results without code modification, and it only knows linear gradient.
So I've written an ExponentialRadialGradientFill class instead. By the
way, admin client applicatioin is almost ready. Only server-side admin,
and stress test is left. Then comes documentation and testing. Yeah.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">28 September 2007</p>
<p>Madness!!!
Somehow i deleted all my server source playing with jar manifest!!!
Aaaaargh!!! Fortunately i made a backup three days ago, and i was
working mainly on the client in the past days, so i could rewrite
missing parts from head between 1 AM and 3 AM :( I also made a party in
the evening in my flat, so i'm a little bit tired.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">26 September 2007</p>
<p>Very
nice progress in the last two days, I started creating the first demo
application: Milenia Grafter chat. Yesterday i made the design, and
written a simple Table component for nick name listing, and a slider
component for nick/chat sliding. Today i renewed my
cube-screen-switching effect, it is real 3D now. I also created an
"exploding window" effect for the login window, they are really
spectacular.</p>
<p>Tomorrow i will finish the chat,
maybe the server side logic also, and only the admin application is
left, and testing can begin. Wow.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">19 September 2007</p>
<p>10:30</p>
<p>I
switched to non-blocking sockets, and it is annoying. Blocking sockets
would be great, because i can check data availability with
inputstream.available( ), so i can avoid thread blocking. The only
thing it can't do is checking end of stream without blocking the
thread, and that's a shame. :( So i swithed to SocketChannels.</p>
<p>23.56</p>
<p>This
was one of the hardest day in my programmer career... :D from 11 AM to
22 PM i was trying to figure out why the publisher client stops
publishing after 90 seconds... it just stopped, no data in or out, but
it wasn't disconnected... i've tried everything, i rewrote thread
handling twice, wrote many test clients, debug traces everywhere, and
nothing... i'm a typical capriconr, i felt like dying... but i never
give up :D so, i've realized that it must be something with flash
player 9, because red5 also dies in the first second, and i've used
red5 for rtmp message testing, so i had to get an Adobe FMS somehow...
after a short search i've found a page with live streaming, and after
five minutes of reverse engineering the communication between the
client and the server i managed to connect and publish my stream :D so
i started tcp dumping, and after 10 megabytes of raw data i stopped. I
started to filter the data every possible way to find something
unusual, and after a little sucking, i realized thatunlike red5 fms
sends a clientBW, serverBW, and a long ping in one packet at the
beginning. ( so i wouldn't have to dump 10 megabytes :D ). and victory,
it works like an angel :D</p>
<p>tomorrow i implement
stream access control with stream event listeners, and server-to-server
streaming. I did the active handshake part in the morning.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">18 September 2007</p>
<p>Live
streaming is bugfixed!!! RTMP's live streaming is a really stupid and
annoying thing. First the client sends a createStream invoke, you have
to pass back a result, containing a streamID generated by the server.
Okay. Then the client sends a publishStream/playStream invoke with the
stream name, and without any of the previous id's. But you have to pair
somehow the stream name, and the server generated id, because
deleteStream passes only the server generated stream id. So the only
connection point is that publishStream/playStream comes after
createStream synchronously, but it is not ensured by the protocol. If
only the whole communication would come on the same rtmp address,
everything would be okay.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">17 september 2007</p>
<p>I've chased a deadlock for three hours, then i realized that
inputstream.read( ) blocks the thread... lame :D</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">16 September 2007</p>
<p>Stream
recording is ready. It tricked me a little, i tought that i have to
increase audio data's timestamp independently from video, but after two
hours of trying it appeared that another bug caused trouble.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">12 September 2007</p>
<p>At
4:44 PM live streaming worked for the first time! I'm very optimistic
about the performance, i published a 320x240 stream with 25 fps, 30
Kbytes/sec, and with ten subscribers the cpu usage of the server is
still under 1 percent.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">02 September 2007</p>
<p>RTMP
Serializer/Deserializer is ready. I started working on the server one
week ago, after a few test applications, and heavy understanding of the
rtmp protocol, but i'm still very pleased about the progress.</p>
